# Single Particle Tracking and Randomly Trapped Random Walks Project

## Overview

This project, undertaken for the Stochastic Modelling exam at the University of Trieste, investigates single particle tracking (SPT), anomalous diffusion, and the theory of randomly trapped random walks (RTRW). In contrast to Fickian diffusion (the basis of typical Brownian motion), particle movement in complex media (e.g., porous materials, polymers, crowded systems) exhibits sub- or superdiffusion, and ergodicity breaking. These phenomena are modeled by various stochastic processes. Randomly trapped random walks provide a theoretical framework for understanding subdiffusion, where temporary trapping events cause deviations from normal Brownian motion.
