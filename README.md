# Single Particle Tracking and Randomly Trapped Random Walks Project

## Overview

This project is done to fulfill the requirment of the stochastic modelling exam in the University of Trieste. It focuses on single particle tracking, anomalous diffusion and the theoretical framework of randomly trapped random walks (RTRW). Unlike fickian (typical, as in the origin of brownian motion) diffusion, the movement of individual particles in complex media, doesn't exhibit normal diffusion, but sub or super diffusion. These particles experiences ergodicity breaking and is modeled by different stochastic processes. By complex media I mean porous materials, polymers, or systems that are molecularly crowded. Randomly trapped random walks offer a theoretical model to understand anomalous diffusion, particularly subdiffusion, where particles can become temporarily trapped, leading to deviations from normal Brownian motion.
